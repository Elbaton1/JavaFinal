## Overview

This E-Commerce platform is a console-based Java application that integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage. Users can register as buyers, sellers, or admins, and each role has specific functionalities:

- **Buyers**: Browse products, search products.

- **Admins**: View and manage all users and products.

## Prerequisites

  psql -U postgres -d ecommerce -f src/main/resources/data.sql

  ```
